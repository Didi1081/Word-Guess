//These are functions? IF ELSE STATEMENTS - to play the game
//1.) Directions to play should be on the screen, which it already is.
//2.) A word should be generated by the computer from the array and only the amount of dashes should be displayed. (document.getElementById("wordHolder").innerHTML = dashes;)
//3.) After the user presses the key if it is a correct letter it needs to go in the wordHolder section and replace the dash.
      //else the letter needs to go in the wrong guess section. It also needs to show up on the browser.

     // How to split a word into an array and do a loop on it. Easier way is to create a syntax to treat a string (ex cat) as an array and then you can make 
     // a loop for that.

//4.)The number of Guesses should be set to 10.



//5.)When the user presses a key, the number of Guesses remaining should go down by 1. If there are no more guesses, then 
//it should reset.

//6.) If the user wins or losses after 10 key presses, the word should show up. 

//7.) It should reset and a new word should randomly generate

//These are more functions or where it displays on the browser? I don't know what these are really called.
